# MazeGenerator
Generates a maze using a recursive division algorithm.
Solves maze first by using a recursive backtracking algorithm and then by using the A* pathfinding algorithm
Programmed in Python using the PyGame library.

The green represents the recusive backtracking algorithm trying to find the end of the maze.  The red represents the backtracking.
The blue represents the path found by the recursive backtracking algorithm.  The orange represents the A* pathfinding algorithm.
