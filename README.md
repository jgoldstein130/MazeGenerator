# MazeGenerator
Generates a maze using a recursive division algorithm.
Solves maze first by using Depth First Search (DFS) and then by using the A* pathfinding algorithm
Programmed in Python using the PyGame library.

The green represents DFS trying to find the end of the maze.  The red represents the backtracking done by DFS.
The blue represents the path found by DFS.  The orange represents the A* pathfinding algorithm.
